# Visualizing-Premier-League-Data

The top-20 football clubs play in the English Premier League Football (EPL) games. 
Some of the games played in the EPL are considered derbies. A derby can be understood as a game between two teams that share an intense rivalry. 
This rivalry can due many factors such as close geographical proximity of their home cities, historical factors, political factors and previous game outcomes. 
As result these games traditionally gain more attraction. So in this project I will explore how derbies affect games played by the rival team in 
Premier League Football.

This will allow us to compare the performance and level of aggression of teams in derby matches with performance of teams in non-derby matches. 
I hope to also add another perceptive of looking at this data from geographical location of these matches. 
The data would also examine whether the teams were playing as the away team or hosting the other team as home team.
